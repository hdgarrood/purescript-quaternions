-- | The quaternions are a number system which generalise the complex numbers,
-- | in a similar way to how the complex numbers generalise the real numbers.
-- | One interesting aspect of the quaternions is that they satisfy all but one
-- | of the requirements to be a field; they only fail to be a field because
-- | their multiplication is non-commutative.
-- |
-- | Just as complex numbers can be thought of as pairs of real numbers, where
-- | the first is the "real part" and the second is the "imaginary part",
-- | quaternions can be thought of as a pair containing a "real part", which is
-- | again simply a real number, and a "vector part", which is a vector in R^3.
-- | Addition of quaternions is then easy to define: the sum of two quaternions
-- | has a real part equal to the sum of the operands' real parts, and a vector
-- | part equal to the sum of the operands' vector parts.
-- |
-- | There are four particularly important quaternions, which are known as the
-- | "basis elements". The first is `1`, which (when considered as a
-- | quaternion) has a real part of `1` and a vector part of `0` (i.e. the zero
-- | vector). The standard basis vectors in R^3 are commonly written as `e_1`,
-- | `e_2`, and `e_3`; the quaternions with a real part of 0 and a vector part
-- | of `e_1`, `e_2`, and `e_3` are called `i`, `j`, and `k` respectively, and
-- | form the other three basis elements.
-- |
-- | These four elements are called the basis elements because every quaternion
-- | can be written as `a + bi + cj + dk` for a choice of real numbers `a`,
-- | `b`, `c`, and `d`.
-- |
-- | Now, we can define multiplication on quaternions just by defining
-- | multiplication on the basis elements `1`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, for which we
-- | use the formula:
-- |
-- | ```
-- | i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1
-- | ```
-- |
-- | One of the first things we can deduce is that the multiplicative inverse
-- | of `i` is `-i` (just as with complex numbers), and also that the inverses
-- | of `j` and `k` are `-j` and `-k` respectively.
-- |
-- | From here we can calculate products between any two basis elements. For
-- | example, to calculate the product `jk`, we notice that `i^2 = ijk` and
-- | therefore we can cancel `i` on the left to yield `i = jk`. As another
-- | example, to calculate the product `ik`, we may start with the equation
-- | `i = jk` and multiply both sides by `k`, yielding `ik = jk^2 = -j`. All
-- | other products of basis elements may be obtained in a similar fashion.
-- |
-- | Knowing the products of basis elements and using the distributive law, we
-- | can find the product of any two quaternions:
-- |
-- | ```
-- | (a + bi + cj + dk) * (e + fi + gj + hk)
-- | = ae + afi + agj + ahk
-- |   + bei + bf(i^2) + bg(ij) + bh(ik)
-- |   + cej + cf(ji) + cg(j^2) + ch(jk)
-- |   + dek + df(ki) + dg(kj) + dh(k^2)
-- | = ae - bf - cg - dh
-- |   + (af + be + ch - dg) i
-- |   + (ag - bh + ce + df) j
-- |   + (ah + bg - cf + de) k
-- | ```
-- |
-- | Note that quaternion multiplication is not commutative; that is, `p * q`
-- | is usually not the same as `q * p`. For example, `ij = k`, but `ji = -k`.
-- |
-- | Like the real numbers, however, each quaternion does have a multiplicative
-- | inverse, i.e. for each quaternion `p` there exists a unique quaternion `q`
-- | such that `p * q = q * p = 1`.
-- |
-- | This means that there are two ways of dividing quaternions. If we want to
-- | divide a quaternion `p` by another quaternion `q`, we can multiply `p` by
-- | the multiplicative inverse of `q`, which can be written `q^-1`. Of course,
-- | we have two ways of doing this; `p * q^-1` and `q^-1 * p` will not
-- | necessarily be the same, so we are really dealing with two different
-- | operations here. We call the operation taking `p` and `q` to `q^-1 * p`
-- | "left-division", and the alternative operation which yields `p * q^-1`
-- | "right-division".
-- |
-- | The most important application of quaternions in computing is for
-- | representing orientations and rotations in 3D space; see the
-- | Data.Quaternion.Rotation module for more details of this.
module Data.Quaternion where

import Prelude
import Data.Vector3 (Vec3(), vec3)
import Math as Math

-- | A quaternion. The type parameter denotes the underlying type. Note that
-- | the underlying type should be a reasonable approximation of the real
-- | numbers; if this is not the case, some of the functions may exhibit
-- | strange behaviour.
-- |
-- | Because multiplication of quaternions is non-commutative, there is no
-- | `CommutativeRing` instance, and consequently no `EuclideanRing` or `Field`
-- | instance either.
-- |
-- | This means, amongst other things, that the `(/)` operator from Prelude
-- | cannot be used with `Quaternion` values. However, `Quaternion` does have
-- | a `DivisionRing` instance, so you can use `leftDiv` and `rightDiv` from
-- | the module `Data.DivisionRing` from the `prelude` library instead.
